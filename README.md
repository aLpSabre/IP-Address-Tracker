### What I learned

I have learned how to fetch data from an API with asyn functions and use special methods from the API's


```js
const getIP = async function (ip) {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(`https://ipapi.co/${ip}/json/`);

    if (res.error) {
      renderError();
      throw new Error(`${res.status}`);
    }
    const data = await res.json();
    renderData(data);
  }
  catch (error) {
    
  }
}
```
### Useful resources

- [IAPI](https://ipapi.co/) -I used this API to get the informations about IP's.
- [Ipify](https://www.ipify.org/) -I used this API to get the informations about IP's.
- [JAWG](https://www.jawg.io/docs/) -I used the tile for the map with Leaflet.
- [Leaflet Providers](https://github.com/leaflet-extras/leaflet-providers) -An extension to Leaflet that contains configurations for various free tile providers.
